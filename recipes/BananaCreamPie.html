    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Banana Cream Pie is a sumptuous dessert that epitomizes comfort with its creamy, 
        dreamy filling and indulgent flavor profile. At its heart lies a flaky, buttery crust that cradles 
        layers of rich vanilla custard and ripe, sweet bananas. The pie is crowned with a lofty, whipped cream 
        topping, each dollop like a cloud atop this confectionery masterpiece. A final garnish of delicate banana 
        slices and a dusting of cinnamon or chocolate shavings adds both visual appeal and a hint of spice or decadence.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

            then gradually whisk egg yolk mixture into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 2 more minutes.
