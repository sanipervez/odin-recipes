    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Chicken Francaise is a culinary delight that marries the simplicity of Italian-American cuisine with a touch of elegance. 
        This dish features tender chicken cutlets that are lightly dredged in flour and dipped in a beaten egg mixture, 
        creating a delicate, golden crust when pan-fried. The chicken is then bathed in a vibrant, lemon-infused butter sauce, 
        which is artfully reduced to a silken consistency, accentuating the chicken’s succulent texture. Garnished with a sprinkle 
        of fresh parsley and a generous squeeze of lemon</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <h3><strong>Chicken</strong></h3>

    <p><ul>
        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3><strong>Sauce</strong></h3>

    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ounce brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®), or to taste</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Make the chicken: Remove tenderloin from each chicken breast half, then fillet each half into two slices. 
            Pound all chicken, including tenderloins, to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li> 
        <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl and pour in enough milk to completely cover; soak for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, Pecorino Romano, and parsley together in a bowl. Remove chicken from milk and dredge in 
            bread crumb mixture until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned, 
            2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking dish, season with salt and pepper, and place lemon slices over top.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Pour wine into the skillet with chicken drippings and bring to a boil while scraping the browned 
            bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth and lemon juice; boil until reduced by half, 
            5 to 10 minutes. Pour wine mixture over chicken, then drizzle orange liqueur over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run 
            clear, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol></p>
